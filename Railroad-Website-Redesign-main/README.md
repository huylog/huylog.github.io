## Redesign of a local train museum's website
__rrhistoricalmuseum.zoomshare.com   <---- the og__


```
    A single shared external style sheet
    A minimum of 4 pages
        Examples: home, tours, reservations, schedule
    The website MUST demonstrate responsiveness - obvious differences between a phone display and the desktop display
    One of the pages must be a form that includes at least:
        A text box
        A selection list
        A radio or checkbox selection
        A submit button that returns a response page (thankyou.html)
        The returned response page does NOT count as one of the 4 required pages but should still look consistent with the rest of the site
    Your site must demonstrate the proper use of implementing images with alignment that looks like it flows with the text, utilizing float properties as needed
    Your site must demonstrate the correct usage of either flex or grid
    Your pages must all validate, both CSS and HTML (warnings are ok. Also google fonts doesn't validate. This won't count against you here)
    Code is written from scratch. There should not be code from another project within this project
        All the code that is submitted is being implemented in the final project
            eg: on a style sheet if there is a rule like #oddNumberedThings but there are not any elements in your website with and  id="oddNumberedThings" this will be considered work not created from scratch on this project - copied and pasted from an outside source
